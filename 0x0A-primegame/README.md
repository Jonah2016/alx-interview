For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.

## Concepts Needed:
# Prime Numbers:
1. Understanding what prime numbers are.
2. Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

# Sieve of Eratosthenes:
1. An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.

## Game Theory:
1. Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
2. Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.

# Dynamic Programming/Memoization:
1. Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

## Python Programming:
1. Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
2. Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
