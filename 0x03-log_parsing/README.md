For the “0x03. Log Parsing” project, you will need to apply your knowledge of Python programming, focusing on parsing and processing data streams in real-time. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), handling data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that you might find useful:

### Concepts Needed:

## File I/O in Python:
1. Understand how to read from sys.stdin line by line.
2. Python Input and Output

## Signal Handling in Python:
1. Handling keyboard interruption (CTRL + C) using signal handling in Python.
2. Python Signal Handling

## Data Processing:
1. Parsing strings to extract specific data points.
2. Aggregating data to compute summaries.

## Regular Expressions:
1. Using regular expressions to validate the format of each line.
2. Python Regular Expressions

## Dictionaries in Python:
1. Using dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
2. Python Dictionaries

## Exception Handling:
1. Handling possible exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
2. Python Exceptions
3. By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be well-prepared to tackle the log parsing project, effectively handling data streams, parsing log entries, and computing metrics based on the processed data.
